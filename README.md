# UsefulTools
Just a public list of the tools I have found useful and why, in no particular order.

## [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) 
In the little experience I have currently with web development, I have found Tailwind to be a useful program. I prefer it to standard CSS because of its ease of use and how easy it is to setup. There is very little setup cost, and it is used by things like DaisyUI which helps non-creative types like me make websites.

## [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com)
I'm not very creative, and I struggle to design websites. DaisyUI makes it easier to get good color schemes and easy plug and play CSS styles.

## [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com)
From the makers of Tailwind CSS, Heroicons gives MIT Licensed svg icons for free. Simple.

##[TailwindCSS/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin)
From tailwindcss comes the typography plugin. It adds styling to h1 and other tags which tailwind gets rid of.
